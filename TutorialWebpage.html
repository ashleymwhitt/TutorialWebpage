            <h3>So, you're thinking about making the leap to learn JavaScript? Congragulations! It can be a very scary
                endevor for some. But, it's a great decision! JavaScript is used everywhere on the internet. It’s a
                programming language used to make not only websites but games, web apps, animations, and mobile
                applications for both Android and iOS. Learning to code in JavaScript will arm you with one of today’s
                most versatile and sought-after skills, making you ready for a new career or giving you a competitive
                edge in your current one.</h3>

            <h3>This website will introduce you to some of the basic building blocks of JavaScript.</h3>

            <h2 id="Functions">Functions</h2>
            <img src="FXs.jpg" />

            <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure
                - a set of statements that perform a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it
                somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it. </p>

            <p>The function example illustratd above is defined with the 'function' keyword, followed by a name,
                followed by parentheses (). The parentheses may include parameter names seperated by commas. The code to
                be executed by the function is placed inside curly brackets {}. Functions can contain letters,
                digits,underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).</p>

            <p>What purpose does a function serve? It allows you to reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many
                times.</p>

            <h3>Function Invocation</h3>
            <p>The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function: an event that
                occurs (when a user clicks a button)</p>

            <h3>Function Return</h3>
            <p>When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. If the function was invoked
                from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement. Functions
                often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller"</p>

            <h2 id="Objects">Objects</h2>
            <img src="Objects.jpg" />

            <p>Objects are variables, too. But objects can contain many values. An object is a collection of properties,
                and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. The values are writeen as
                name:value pairs, that is, the name and value are serparated by a colon. A property's value can be a
                function, in which case the property is known as a method.</p>

            <h2 id="Arrays">Arrays</h2>
            <img src="Arrays.jpg" />

            <p>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. However, what if you want
                to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300? The solution
                is an array! An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by
                referring to an index number.</p>

            <h2 id="For Loops">For Loops</h2>
            <img src="ForLoops.jpg" />

            <p>Loops can execute a block of code a number of times. Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code
                over and over again, each time with a different value. A for loop repeats until a specified condition
                evaluates to false. </p>

            <h2 id="Conditionals">Conditionals</h2>

            <p>Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Very often
                when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions. You can use
                conditional statements in your code to do this.</p>

            <p> JavaScript we have the following conditional statements: If, Else, Else If, Switch.</p>

            <h3>The If Statement</h3>
            <img src="IfConds.jpg" />
            <p>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.</p>

            <h3>The Else Statement</h3>
            <img src="ElseConds.jpg" />
            <p>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is false.</p>

            <h3>The ElseIf Statement</h3>
            <img src="ElseIfConds.jpg" />
            <p>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.</p>

            <h3>The Switch Statement</h3>
            <img src="SwitchConds.jpg" />
            <p>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.</p>
